OWL Pipe

OWL Pipe is a light-weight Pipeline framework. It is implemented as a Python 
module called owl_pipe with no dependencies other than a reasonably recent 
version of Python (see below for further information). It is either called "OWL 
Pipe" or owl_pipe. The two names are used interchangeably in this document.

OWL Pipe allows developers to construct Python based scientific pipelines out of
reusable code. The framework provides two useful containers: a Pipeline object 
and a Stage object.

A Pipeline is an ordered collection of Stages. Stages are typically atomic 
operations performed on the data being processed by the Pipeline itself. As a
simple example from basic astronomical processing, a Stage could be the bias
subtraction step while a pipeline could be basic image detrending.

Pipelines in owl_pipe are built by creating an ASCII configuration file. That 
file is where, among other things, the Stages forming that pipeline are defined.
Each Stage has a separate configuration file where parameters and I/O 
information for that Stage can be specified.

Both Pipeline and Stage instances have access to some instance variables:
    1. log: a Logger instance from the Python logging module.
    2. clipboard: a dictionary for passing data in-memory across Stages (see 
       below)
    3. qualified_name: fully qualified name, mostly used in logs. For Pipeline
       instances it is <system>.<name>. For Stage instances it is 
       <pipeline qualified_name>.<name>.
    4. name: the Pipeline/Stage name.
Pipeline instances have these additional instance variables:
    1. system: the name of the Pipeline system.
    2. log_level: the log threshold.
    3. local_logs: boolean determining whether to write logs to disk or STDOUT.
    4. stages: list of Stage instances for that Pipeline.
Stage instances have these additional instance variables:
    1. pipeline: the Pipeline instance the Stage belongs to.
    2. input_info: a dictionary corresponding to the input dictionary in the
       Stage configuration file (see below).
    3. output_info: a dictionary corresponding to the output dictionary in the
       Stage configuration file (see below).
    4. Any parameter defined in the parameters dictionary in the Stage 
       configuration file (see below).

Clearly, OWL Pipe stands on the shoulder of giants, among which NOAO NHPPS and 
LSST pex_harness. As such it borrows features and ideas from its predecessors
quite heavily.



Requirements
OWL Pipe uses the "ConfigObj" module together with the optional Validation code.
It also requires a reasonably recent version of Python, likely 2.5 or later.
Python or later can be obtained from http://www.python.org
ConfigObj can be found at http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html but
remember to download both configobj.py and validate.py or the .zip file which 
contains both. Alternatively, download from PyPI (or by using easy_install).



Installation
Installation uses the standard python distutil module as detailed in the Python 
web site: http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#install-index

Basically, 
    shell> python setup.py install
should suffice.



Configuration File Format
The Pipeline and Stage definition files are written in INI format with some
extensions such as the use of '#' to indicate comments or string interpolation 
(see http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html#the-config-file-format).



Pipeline Definition File Structure
Required high level dictionaries:
    1. Pipeline

Optional high level dictionaries:
    None

The Pipeline dictionary
Required keys:
    1. name: the name of the Pipeline, can be anything and is only used in logs.
    2. system: the name of the pipeline system. Again it can be anything and
       is only used in logs to group pipelines together.
    3. stages: a list of dictionaries, each one defining a Stage (see below).
Optional keys:
    1. log_level: if present, it must be one of the log levels defined by the
       Python logging module. It defaults to "DEBUG".
    2. local_log_mode: if present and true, a log file is written to disk in the
       local directory as <system>.<name>.log. If false, log messages are 
       written to STDOUT. It defaults to false.

Dictionaries in the stages list
Required keys:
    1. name: the name of the Stage instance. Can be anything and is only used in
       logs.
    2. config_file: the path to the Stage configuration file (see below).
    3. python_class: the fully qualified name of the Python class to instantiate
       for the Stage.
Optional keys:
    None



Stage Configuration File Structure
Required high level dictionaries:
    None

Optional high level dictionaries:
    1. parameters
    2. input
    3. output

The parameters dictionary
Required keys:
    None
Optional keys:
    1. Parameter name: parameter value. The Stage instance will have access to 
       parameters by name directly (i.e. as instance variables of the 
       appropriate type, accessed using the usual Python self. notation). Only
       simple JSON types are supported (i.e. int, float, bool, str).

The input dictionary
Required keys:
    None
Optional keys:
    1. Name of clipboard keys holding input data for the Stage instance. The 
       corresponding value is the fully qualified name of a Python class. The
       Stage instance will check at run time that the clipboard object 
       corresponding to this key is indeed an instance of that Python class.

The output dictionary
Required keys:
    None
Optional keys:
    1. Name of clipboard keys holding output data for the Stage instance. The 
       corresponding value is the fully qualified name of a Python class. The
       Stage instance will check at run time that the object to put on the 
       clipboard at that key is indeed an instance of that Python class.
