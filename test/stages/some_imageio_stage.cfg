    // in the clipboard and can be expected to put some other data in the 
    // clipboard as well. In order to do so, and in order to understand what is
    // what among clipboard keys, we use this double indirection method. We 
    // specify abstract names as <Stage variable> to which we associate the real
    // clipboard key names (<clipboard key>). We can also associate a data type
    // (<clipboard item class>) for run-time type checking.
